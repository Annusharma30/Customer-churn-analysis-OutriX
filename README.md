# "The dashboard highlights key metrics such as total customers, churned customers, and overall churn rate.
This gives a quick overview of how serious the churn problem is for the telecom company."

[Contract Type ]
"One of the strongest indicators of churn is contract type.
Customers on month-to-month contracts churn the most, while those on one-year or two-year contracts are far more stable.
This shows the importance of encouraging customers to shift toward long-term plans."

[Payment Method ]
"Another significant factor is payment method.
Electronic check users churn at the highest rate compared to those paying through credit card or bank  transfers.
This insight suggests improving the electronic check process or incentivizing auto-pay methods."

[Tenure ]
"The analysis also reveals that customers with shorter tenures are more likely to leave, while long-term customers show higher loyalty.
This means that the first few months are critical, and telecom companies should focus on strong onboarding and engagement strategies."

[Services & Bundling ]
"Customers who subscribe to multiple services, such as internet plus phone, churn less compared to those with single services.
Encouraging bundling packages can therefore reduce churn and increase loyalty."

"In conclusion, the analysis identifies clear risk groups: short-tenure, month-to-month customers paying with electronic checks.
By addressing these areas with targeted strategies, telecom companies can significantly reduce churn and improve customer retention.
